[EXTERNAL] Ensure Ci2 Access to Documentation: Meeting with CI2 to discuss further on Liam's handoff.
- MyVenue
	- Process:
		- Cashier creation
			- Uses Okta to get the organization information for the Cashier
			- We use Python scripts to automate the creation using MyVenue API
				- Future State: Implement this in Okta Workflows because we can use the attributes in UKG to create the Cashier while onboarding
			- No activation e-mail is sent so Cash and Payments handles the user walkthrough after the Cashiers are created
		  
	- MyVenue flows:
		- **Salesforce to MyVenue Mapping**
			1. Suite Customer Creation:
				- Salesforce queries (use jetstream)
					- Fields to retrieve:
						- AccountID
						- Name
						- Corporate_Account_Eligible__c
						- Charge_To_Corporate_Account_c
							- Add StageName in the query for safety
					- Corporate_Account_Eligible__c & Charge_To_Corporate_Account_c for the account to be charged later
					- To Do: Tax Exempt is not there in SF so it needs to be added to SF so that we can map it to MyVenue
				- MyVenue 'Back Office':
					- Identifier = SF Account ID
					- Name = SF Account Company Name
					- Allow Pay Later (true or false) = Corporate_Account_Eligible__c & Charge_To_Corporate_Account_c (true or false)
					- To Do: Tax Exempt
			2. Suite Customer Contact and Online Login:
				- Salesforce queries:
					- Fields to retrieve:
						- FirstName
						- LastName
						- Phone
						- Email
						- To Do: EOF checkbox
							- This indicates that the Contact will need an Online Login for MyVenue
				- MyVenue 'Back Office':
			3. Event Creation
